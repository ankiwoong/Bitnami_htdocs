          (HTML)</a>
        is the standard markup language for
        <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong>
        and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it
        forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[41] Web
        browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
        and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
        structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
        appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML
        pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive
        forms may be embedded into the rendered page.

        HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
        structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
        quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
        using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce content into the
        page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about document
        text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display
        the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can
        embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which
        affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines
        the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
        maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use
        of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.
