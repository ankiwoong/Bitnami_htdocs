      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
        that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is high-level, often
        just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
        object-orientation, and first-class functions.
        Alongside HTML and CSS, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide
        Web.[8] <span class="js">JavaScript</span> enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
        applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers
        have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute it.</p>
      <img src="http://localhost/img/2.png" width="100%" />
      <p style="margin-top:45px;">
        As a multi-paradigm language, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> supports event-driven, functional, and
        imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates,
        regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself
        does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host
        environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.
        Originally used only in web browsers, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engines are also now embedded in
        server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.
